AuraSR v2 is a second-generation GAN-based Super-Resolution model designed for real-world applications. It's an improved version based on the GigaGAN paper, specifically optimized for upscaling generated images.

Certainly! I'll update the Quick Start section to focus on cloning the repository, installing Cog, and running a prediction. Here's the revised version:

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zsxkib/cog-aura-sr-v2.git
cd cog-aura-sr-v2
```

2. Install Cog:
```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_`uname -s`_`uname -m`
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog
```

3. Run a prediction:
```bash
cog predict -i 'image=@example_input.png'
```
or if it's a url to an image you can do
```bash
cog predict -i image="https://example.com/your_image.png"
```


## What It Does üé®

- Upscales images using advanced GAN-based super-resolution techniques
- Optimized for generated images and high-quality photos
- Supports 4x upscaling with overlapped processing for improved results

## Model Details üìä

- Model size: 618M parameters
- Tensor type: F32
- License: Apache 2.0
  - But this code is MIT (feel free to do whatever you want with it)

## How to Use It üõ†Ô∏è

1. Install the `aura-sr` package
2. Load the model using `AuraSR.from_pretrained("fal/AuraSR-v2")`
3. Use the `upscale_4x_overlapped` method to upscale your images

For detailed usage examples, check the [Hugging Face model page](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraSR-v2).

## Thank You üôå
